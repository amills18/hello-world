Tutorial for Github

My name is Aedan Mills,
I am a 2nd year Computer Science major at Oregon State University. I am really into math, so I have chosen Artificial Intelligence to be my field of interest. The AI path requires a lot of math and machine learning/algorithms, so I have a lot to complete before I am a master!
